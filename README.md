# What this is about:

This is a VR scene I am doing using A-Frame.


# Contents:

The plan is something that vaguely talks about symmetry in the universe and shows by example how translational symmetry implies conservation of linear momentum.

That's the plan I chose, anyways, and yes i dont think it was a very good idea, but I might be wrong.

## Naming incident:

Normally the name was supposed to be symmetrical-cube but I used the interface in VSCodium and i had to create a new one, i wanted the suffix to be cuboi**d**, but a typo got in the way, how terrible :(
